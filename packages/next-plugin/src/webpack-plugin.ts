/**
 * `CassidaWebpackPlugin` — exposes the aggregated `@layer cas` CSS
 * as a webpack-virtual module at the stable path
 * `node_modules/@cassida/next-plugin/virtual.css`. The consumer
 * imports `'@cassida/next-plugin/virtual.css'` from `app/layout.tsx`
 * (or any Server / Client Component) and Next.js's standard CSS
 * pipeline handles the file like any other CSS import — bundling,
 * minification, chunking, and HMR all come along for free.
 *
 * Resolves the "consumer imports virtual module BEFORE the IR
 * loader populates the store" race in two passes per compilation:
 *
 *   1. `compiler.hooks.thisCompilation` — seed the placeholder so
 *      the resolver finds the module when the graph is being built.
 *   2. `compilation.hooks.processAssets` at
 *      `PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_PRE_PROCESS` — every JSX file has
 *      already passed through the `enforce: 'post'` IR loader by
 *      this stage, so `store.allRules()` is complete; we drain the
 *      store via `buildVirtualCss(...)` and overwrite the virtual
 *      content BEFORE CSS minimisers / chunkers run.
 *
 * For dev / HMR: `compiler.hooks.watchRun` subscribes to
 * `store.subscribe()`, so a between-compilation store update (rare,
 * usually from an external watcher) re-writes the virtual module's
 * content and `webpack-virtual-modules` propagates the change as a
 * file-change event through webpack's watcher. Next.js's CSS HMR
 * picks it up — no `module.hot.accept` needed on the consumer side.

 * path the consumer's import ends at — using a hard-coded
 * `node_modules/...` relative path would miss the symlink case
 * and the consumer's import would fall through to the on-disk
